100 Web Vulnerabilities, categorized into various types : üòÄ

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Injection Vulnerabilities:
1. SQL Injection (SQLi)
     What is SQL injection (SQLi)?<br>
      > Ans - A web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to manupulate the database with the help of quaries.<br>
     
     SQL Injection is a code injection technique that attackers can use to insert malicious SQL statements into input fields for execution by the underlying database. Here's a detailed breakdown of how to identify, exploit, and prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities:

Identification:

Manual Testing:

Look for input fields that directly interact with the database, such as search bars, login forms, or parameters in URLs.
Test these fields by entering simple SQL statements like ' OR 1=1 -- - to see if they cause any unexpected behavior or errors.
Automation Tools:

Use automated tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or SQLMap to scan for SQL Injection vulnerabilities. These tools can perform automated tests on input fields and detect potential SQL Injection issues.
Exploitation:

Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection:

Identify a boolean-based condition in the application, such as a login form with a 'Remember Me' checkbox.
Inject ' OR 1=1 -- - to bypass the condition and gain unauthorized access.
Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:

Identify a time delay in the application's response, such as a slow login page.
Inject a time delay function like sleep(5) to cause the application to pause for a certain number of seconds, allowing you to determine the success of your injection.
Union-Based SQL Injection:

Inject a UNION statement to retrieve data from other tables in the database.
Example: ' UNION SELECT password FROM users -- -
Error-Based SQL Injection:

Force the application to generate an error by injecting a syntax error, like ' OR '1'='1.
Analyze the error message to gather information about the database schema and version.
Prevention:

Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:

Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate SQL code from user input.
Example in PHP with PDO:
php


Copy
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username');
$stmt->execute(['username' => $input]);
Input Validation:

Validate and sanitize user input to ensure it only contains expected characters and formats.
Use a whitelist approach to allow only specific characters and reject everything else.
Least Privilege Principle:

Limit the privileges of the database account used by the application to only the necessary permissions.
Regular Updates and Patches:

Keep the application, web server, and database software up-to-date to protect against known vulnerabilities.
Security Headers and Configurations:

Implement security headers and configurations to protect against common web application attacks, such as Content Security Policy (CSP), X-XSS-Protection, and X-Content-Type-Options.>


     
1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)<br>
   * What is cross-site scripting (XSS)?<br>    
      >  Xss its client side vulnerability which allow an attcker to inject malicious script into websites.<br>

   * Impact of XSS vulnerabilities<br>
      > The actual impact of an XSS attack generally depends on the nature of the application, its functionality and data, and the status of the compromised user. For                example:

      > In a brochureware application, where all users are anonymous and all information is public, the impact will often be minimal.<br>
    
      >  In an application holding sensitive data, such as banking transactions, emails, or healthcare records, the impact will usually be serious.<br>
    
      >  If the compromised user has elevated privileges within the application, then the impact will generally be critical, allowing the attacker to take full control of            the vulnerable application and compromise all users and their data.<br>
     
   * What are the types of XSS attacks?<br>
     
      >  Reflected XSS, where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.<br>
      >  Stored XSS, where the malicious script comes from the website's database.<br>
      >  DOM-based XSS, where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.<br>

    * Reflected Xss
      > Reflected xss accour when an attcker able to send malicious script to the web application using URL or submission & the web application reflect those                        scripts without validation.<br>
       

2. Authentication vulnerabilities<br>
   > Authentication vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data and functionality. They also expose additional attack surface for further                exploits.<br>
   
   * What is authentication? <br>
     > ANS - Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client.<br>
                     Something you know, such as a password or the answer to a security question. These are sometimes called "knowledge factors".<br>
                     Something you have, This is a physical object such as a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes called "possession factors".<br>
                     Something you are or do. For example, your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes called "inherence factors".<br>
                     
   * What is the difference between authentication and authorization?<br>
     > Authentication is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be.<BR>
                     Authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.<BR>

     For example, authentication determines whether someone attempting to access a website with the username Carlos123 really is the same person who created the account.

    * How do authentication vulnerabilities arise? <br> 
      > The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against brute-force attacks.<br>
           Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker. This is sometimes called "broken                authentication".<br>

   * How to secure your authentication mechanisms.<br>
     > Take care with user credentials - SOLID CREDENTIALS<br>
          Don't count on users for security. - require some additional effort from your users.<br>
          Prevent username enumeration - NOT  reveal that a user exists on the system.<br>
          Implement robust brute-force protection -  implement strict, IP-based user rate limiting. This should involve measures to prevent attackers from manipulating                their apparent.<BR>
          Triple-check your verification logic<br>
          Don't forget supplementary functionality<br>
          Implement proper multi-factor authentication.<br>


3. What is path traversal?
   * Path traversal is also known as directory traversal. These vulnerabilities enable an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application.<br>
     > Application code and data.<br>
        Credentials for back-end systems.<br>
        Sensitive operating system files.<br>

      > ex- %2e%2e%2f represents ../ - encoding & double encoding <br>
            ..%c0%af represents ../  -  percent URL encoding <br>
            ?file=secret.doc%00.pdf - null byte <br>

     * How to prevent a path traversal attack.<br>
       > verify that the input contains only permitted content, such as alphanumeric characters only.<br>
       > Verify that the canonicalized path starts with the expected base directory.<br>
       > Many application functions that do this can be rewritten to deliver the same behavior in a safer way.<br>
     

4. command injection.<br>
   * What is os command injection?<br>
     > OS command injection is also known as shell injection. It allows an attacker to execute operating system (OS) commands on the server that is running an application.          <br>
     Useful commands : https://github.com/payloadbox/command-injection-payload-list

   * How to find OS command injection vulnerabilities in web applications?<br>
     > Detecting blind OS command injection using time delays.<br>
     > Exploiting blind OS command injection by redirecting output.<br>
     Exploiting blind OS command injection using out-of-band (OAST) techniques.<br>
     
   
   * How to prevent OS command injection vulnerabilities in web applications?<br>
     > Using input sanitization to prevent command injection.<br>
       Using character escaping to prevent command injection.<br>
       Using blacklists to prevent command injection.<br>
       
5. Business logic vulnerabilities<br>
     * Business logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the design & This potentially enables attackers to manipulate legitimate functionality to achieve a malicious goal.<br>
       * How do business logic vulnerabilities arise? <br>
       > Business logic vulnerabilities often arise because the design and development teams make flawed assumptions about how users will interact with the application.                These           bad assumptions can lead to inadequate validation of user input. For example, if the developers assume that users will pass data exclusively via                a web browser,              the application may rely entirely on weak client-side controls to validate input. These are easily bypassed by an attacker using                an intercepting proxy.<br>
       
       * What is the impact of business logic vulnerabilities?<br>
       > Fundamentally, the impact of any logic flaw depends on what functionality it is related to. If the flaw is in the authentication mechanism, for example, this could have a serious impact on your overall security. Attackers could potentially exploit this for privilege escalation, or to bypass authentication entirely, gaining access to sensitive data and functionality. This also exposes an increased attack surface for other exploits.<br>

       * How to prevent business logic vulnerabilities.<br>
            > Make sure developers and testers understand the domain that the application serves.<br>
            > Avoid making implicit assumptions about user behavior or the behavior of other parts of the application.<br>
            > Maintain clear design documents and data flows for all transactions and workflows, noting any assumptions that are made at each stage.<br>
            > Write code as clearly as possible. If it's difficult to understand what is supposed to happen, it will be difficult to spot any logic flaws.<br>
            > Note any references to other code that uses each component. Think about any side-effects of these dependencies if a malicious party were to manipulate them in an unusual way.<br>
